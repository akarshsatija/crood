## Bugs

* Hide Folder Up (back) button when folderPath has no value
* Still haven't figured out the border-radius of .file-list yet
* Change .file-list's name (to .sidebar maybe)
* Clicking on inaccessible folder messes up folderPath
* Back button takes 2 clicks


## Features

* Tests!
* Chrome extension
* Plugin architecture
* List of recent files
* Make the file listing animate in and animate out like cards zooming in from the right and zooming out to left
* Maintain Undo history correctly across files. Maybe save that to localStorage
* Live update
* Make the file listing hide and show UI
* Options menu inside file's li element to rename, copy, etc
* Create new File/Folder
* Rename File/Folder
* Drag and drop move to different folder
* Run command in local folder's command prompt
* Commit to git from inside this? It's possible.
* Make an installable component that enables a hosted version of this to save to local
