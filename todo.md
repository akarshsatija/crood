## Features

* Maintain Undo history correctly across files. Maybe save that to localStorage
* Live update
* List of recent files
* Make the directory listing hide by default and show on hover
* Commit to git from inside this? It's possible.




## Bugs

* Hide Folder Up (back) button when folderPath has no value
* Still haven't figured out the border-radius of .file-list yet
* Change .file-list's name to (.sidebar maybe)
* Clicking on inaccessible folder messes up folderPath
